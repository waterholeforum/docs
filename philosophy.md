# Philosophy

The principles behind Waterhole's design and direction.

## Why Forums Still Matter

Modern online discussion has largely moved to social networks, chat platforms,
and algorithmic feeds. These tools are excellent at driving engagement, but they
are not designed to support durable knowledge, thoughtful discussion, or
community ownership.

Forums still matter because they optimize for **depth over velocity**, **memory
over immediacy**, and **communities over audiences**.

A well-run forum creates a shared public archive. Ideas compound instead of
disappearing into a feed. Conversations can be discovered, referenced, refined,
and revisited years later. Participants are contributors, not content, and
communities are shaped intentionally rather than by opaque algorithms.

Most importantly, forums can be _owned_. You control the rules, the culture, the
data, and the future of your community. There is no feed to game, no ads to
optimize for, and no platform incentives working against the health of the
community itself.

Waterhole exists because we believe that serious communities still need serious
infrastructure — software that respects time, attention, and autonomy.

## Better Communities Begin With Better Software

Better communities don't emerge by accident. They are shaped by the incentives,
constraints, and affordances of the software they run on.

Waterhole is designed to provide a strong, thoughtful foundation for healthy
online communities — without dictating what those communities must become.

## Best Practices and Flexibility

**Waterhole comes with features that streamline the creation of healthy
communities, while still giving you the power to build exactly the community you
need.**

Community management has matured since the early days of forums, and there are
now many well-established best practices. Waterhole aims to integrate these
thoughtfully into the core product, rather than leaving it entirely up to you to
assemble the right behavior through hundreds of settings and third-party
extensions.

Every feature in Waterhole is carefully considered and designed with flexibility
in mind. For example, you can set up your community [Structure](./structure.md)
with a mix of static Pages, Links, and Channels, each with their own unique
layout, filters, instructions, taxonomies, and behavior. Reactions can be used
to support ideation, and [Groups](./groups.md) can elevate permissions or reward
users with status. These essential features are built right into the product,
ensuring they are consistent, high-quality, and well-supported.

At the same time, no two communities are the same. Waterhole embraces this
reality and encourages communities to work with developers to take full
advantage of its extensible codebase. This makes it possible to implement
bespoke functionality without accumulating technical debt or fighting the core
system.

## Sustainable Business Model

**Waterhole has a sustainable, source-available business model.**

The model is simple: we make great software, and you pay to use it. That revenue
goes directly back into improving the product.

Waterhole's source code is public. While this has some disadvantages, we believe
the benefits outweigh them. You can inspect the code, contribute improvements,
build extensions, and evaluate Waterhole thoroughly before committing to a
license.

By charging for licenses, we avoid activities that would distract from product
development, such as soliciting donations or running hosted services. Instead,
we encourage freelancers, agencies, and entrepreneurs to build services and
extensions around Waterhole, forming a healthy ecosystem.

As a company selling software rather than a service, Waterhole is a safer
long-term choice than many alternatives. Licenses are perpetual: you can keep
using the version you paid for, forever. You remain in full control of your
server, your code, and your data — now and in the future.

## Powerless Technology

**Waterhole relies on a simple, resilient, and proven technology stack.**

From its foundational architecture to the implementation of individual features,
Waterhole strives to follow the
[Rule of Least Power](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html):

> Use the least powerful language suitable for expressing information,
> constraints, or programs on the World Wide Web.

Accordingly, Waterhole is not a single-page application built around a heavy
JavaScript framework. Instead, it is a traditional multi-page application built
with the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework, progressively enhanced using
[Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev). This results in fast page loads, graceful
degradation under poor network conditions, and a more resilient user experience
overall.

Just as importantly, this approach significantly reduces codebase complexity,
leading to a more productive and enjoyable developer experience — and a system
that is easier to maintain over the long term.

## Inclusive Design

**Waterhole communities should be inclusive and accessible to everyone.**

Waterhole embodies an inclusive approach in its
[Design System](./design/overview.md) — a sane, human-friendly starting point
optimized for usability. Waterhole strives to be
[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) compliant and provide a good experience
for users of screen readers and alternative input modalities.

Inclusive design is not an afterthought — it is a core part of building
communities that are welcoming, sustainable, and fair.
