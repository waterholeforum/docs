# Contributing

There are many ways that you can contribute to Waterhole development, including bug reports, documentation edits, translations, and core enhancements.

Thank you for taking the time to consider a contribution. Please take a moment to read through Waterhole's [Code of Conduct](contributing.md). By participating here, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Waterhole Is Not FOSS

Waterhole is not "Free Open-Source Software". It is **proprietary** source-available software. The code is available, and you can download it for free, but there are limitations to what you can do with it:

-   You **cannot** alter code or behavior related to licensing, updating, version checking, or anything else that would circumvent the enforcement of our business model.

-   You **cannot** redistribute or use Waterhole as a dependency in another distributable project without prior permission or licensing.

-   You **cannot** publicly maintain a fork of Waterhole.

For more information, see the [license terms](https://waterhole.dev/terms).

## Security Disclosures

If you discover a security vulnerability, please review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/waterholeforum/core/security/policy), then report the issue directly to us from [waterhole.dev/support](https://waterhole.dev/support). We will review and respond privately via email. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Bug Reports

> **Warning:** Waterhole's GitHub issue trackers are not intended to provide help or support. Instead, get support from the [community](https://waterhole.dev/community/channel/support), or from [waterhole.dev/support](https://waterhole.dev/support) if you have an active license.

Found a bug? Great! We'd love to hear about it ‚Äì but first you should search through the [community](https://waterhole.dev/community) and [issue tracker](https://github.com/waterholeforum/core/issues) to make sure you're not wasting your time on a known issue.

If you do find a similar issue, upvote it by adding a üëç reaction. Only leave a comment if you have relevant information to add.

If no one has filed the issue yet, feel free to [submit a new one](https://github.com/waterholeforum/core/issues/new). Please include a clear description of the issue, and as much relevant information as possible.

Remember: the goal of a bug report is to make it easy for us to replicate the bug and fix it. You might want to read [this article](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) for some useful tips on how to write an effective bug report. It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear reproduction steps will not be triaged.

## Feature Requests

Have an idea for a feature? Head on over to the [Ideas](https://waterhole.dev/community/channel/ideas) channel in our community, where you can vote for features you want, and submit new ideas for consideration.

## Documentation Edits

Waterhole's documentation lives in the [waterholeforum/docs](https://github.com/waterholeforum/docs) repository. Improvements or corrections to them can be submitted as a pull request.

## Core Enhancements

We welcome pull requests to the [waterholeforum/core](https://github.com/waterholeforum/core) repository. Pull requests should clearly describe the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if there is one. If the pull request fixes a bug, it should include a new test case that demonstrates the issue, if possible.

Do not commit any changes to compiled files, like those found in `resources/dist`. Due to their large size, they cannot realistically be reviewed. To defend against possible injection of malicious code, all compiled files will be generated and committed by the core Waterhole team.

If you would like to work on a new feature, consider discussing it first in the [Ideas](https://waterhole.dev/community/channel/ideas) channel before you spend time on it. While we appreciate community contributions, we are quite selective about what features make it into Waterhole itself, so don't take it the wrong way if we suggest that you pursue the idea as an extension instead.

## Translations

We welcome new translations and updates to existing ones. Please follow [these instructions](localization.md) on how to contribute to Waterhole's translation files.
