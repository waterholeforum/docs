# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed used by the Waterhole community for communication. This includes the Waterhole forum, GitHub, Twitter, and any other relevant forums.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report it by emailing [hello@waterhole.dev](mailto:hello@waterhole.dev). Your identity will remain confidential.

- **Be civil.** This is an inclusive community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. Be kind, patient, and respectful towards everyone, including people outside of the Waterhole community.

- **No personal attacks.** Criticizing ideas, by means of reasoned arguments, is an important part of what we're doing here. But it's not okay for that to devolve into personal attacks. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are never acceptable.

- **Assume good faith.** When there is disagreement, try to understand why, always assuming good intentions. Remember that different people have different perspectives on issues, and that's okay.
